ENVIRONMENTAL MEDIA, MEDIA ECOLOGIES AND THE TECHNOSPHERE
With the ubiquity of digital media technologies come media theories that understand them in their infrastructural, environmental and ecological registers. Terms such as ecology and environment are often used interchangeably to denote networked technological agencies, planetary concerns and intricate entanglements of humans and technology. While ecological thought has entered media and cultural studies in these ways, and media technologies have entered ecological thought, often a concern for what used to be called nature or the environment is eschewed in visions of technospheric futures. What is at stake in comprehending digital cultures in terms of (media) ecology? What kinds of methods are required to study not singular media but digital media technologies which saturate our surrounds? What forms of (techno)politics are called for when these media are imbued with the computational and sensory capacities of artificial intelligence and data capture? How can  different approaches to digital media and ecology be brought into conversation in ways that signal a concern for what used to be called nature?
